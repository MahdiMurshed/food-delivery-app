# Project Rules for Using Cursor Editor with React Native/Expo

## Coding Standards

1. **File Structure**
   - `src/` directory for all application code
   - `components/` for reusable UI components
   - `screens/` for full application screens
   - `navigation/` for navigation configuration
   - `assets/` for static assets (images, fonts)
   - `hooks/` for custom React hooks
   - `constants/` for app-wide constants
   - `utils/` for utility functions
   - `types/` for TypeScript type definitions
   - `services/` for API calls and external services

2. **Component Rules**
   - Use functional components with hooks
   - Create component files using PascalCase
   - Co-locate component styles in the same file
   - Export components as default exports
   - Include component prop type definitions

3. **TypeScript Usage**
   - Strict type checking enabled
   - No use of `any` type (use `unknown` when necessary)
   - Create interfaces for component props
   - Use type guards for conditional rendering

4. **Styling Approach**
   - Use StyleSheet for performance optimization
   - Create a central theme file for colors/spacing/typography
   - Avoid inline styles except for dynamic values
   - Use React Native's Platform API for platform-specific styles

## Development Workflow

1. **Version Control**
   - Commit early and often
   - Use meaningful commit messages
   - Create feature branches for new functionality
   - Perform self-code reviews before merging

2. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for critical functionality
   - Test deep linking and notifications

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Memoize expensive calculations with `useMemo`
   - Use `useCallback` for functions passed to child components
   - Implement list virtualization with `FlatList`/`SectionList`


## Documentation

1. **Code Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments for functions and components
   - Document complex logic with inline comments
   - Maintain a README with setup instructions
   - Document known issues and workarounds
