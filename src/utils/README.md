# Utilities

This directory contains utility functions and helper methods used throughout the application.

## Guidelines

- Group related utilities in separate files by functionality
- Export utilities as named exports
- Include TypeScript types for parameters and return values
- Add JSDoc comments to document each utility's purpose and usage
- Write pure functions when possible
- Avoid side effects in utility functions
