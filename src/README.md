# Source Directory

This is the main source directory for the food delivery application. It contains all application code organized into subdirectories by functionality.

## Directory Structure

- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks

- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `services/`: API calls and external services

## Guidelines

- Follow the project's coding standards for each subdirectory
- Maintain separation of concerns between different modules
- Use TypeScript for type safety throughout the codebase
- Document code with JSDoc comments
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
