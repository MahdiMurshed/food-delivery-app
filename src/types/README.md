# Types

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions used throughout the application.

## Guidelines

- Group related types in separate files by domain
- Export types as named exports
- Use interfaces for objects with methods or for inheritance
- Use type aliases for unions, intersections, or simple object shapes
- Add JSDoc comments to document complex types
- Avoid using `any` type; use `unknown` when necessary
