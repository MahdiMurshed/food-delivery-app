# Services

This directory contains service modules for external API calls and data handling.

## Guidelines

- Organize services by domain or external API
- Use TypeScript for type safety in request and response objects
- Implement proper error handling
- Use environment variables for API keys and endpoints
- Add retry logic for network requests when appropriate
- Include documentation for each service method
