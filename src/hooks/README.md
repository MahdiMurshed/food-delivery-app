# Hooks

This directory contains custom React hooks used throughout the application.

## Guidelines

- Each hook should be in its own file
- Hook names should start with `use` (e.g., `useAuth`, `useCart`)
- Export hooks as named exports
- Include TypeScript types for parameters and return values
- Add JSDoc comments to document the hook's purpose and usage
